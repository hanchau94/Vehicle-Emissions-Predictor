# Evaluating the CO2 Emission from Gasoline-Powered Light-Duty Vehicles

Welcome to our project focused on assessing CO2 emissions from gasoline-powered light-duty vehicles. In an era where environmental sustainability is paramount, understanding and regulating vehicle emissions is critical. Our project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze vehicle data, predict CO2 emissions, and compare them against predefined thresholds.

## Objectives

- **Assess CO2 Emissions:** Predict CO2 emissions from gasoline-powered light-duty vehicles.
- **Compare with Thresholds:** Determine if the emissions exceed predefined thresholds.
- **Support Regulatory Efforts:** Aid in regulatory efforts and promote cleaner transportation practices.

## Methodology

Our project employs various machine learning techniques to process and analyze vehicle data. We use advanced models to predict CO2 emissions and evaluate them against specified thresholds. By accurately identifying vehicles that exceed these thresholds, we contribute to efforts aimed at reducing environmental impact.
